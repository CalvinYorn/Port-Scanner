Personal Project : Port Scanner with Python and Nmap

Why:
I wanted to make this project to incoporate using Nmap(Network Mapper) and implemented a python script to see what ports were open or filtered. This was done ethically through using
the IP address of http://scanme.nmap.org/

1) run ping scanme.nmap.org
2) grab the IP address, then run this file with -python port-scanner-nmap-py
3) enter the IP address
4) enter the port range you want to look at
5) the script will output or give you what ports are open or filtered

Outcomes:
Taught me how to write and use python scripts with Nmap as well as teaching me a little of what Nmap does.
I plan on building more to this project.
